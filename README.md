# Logic and Arithmetic operations with OpenCV
Python and Opencv project to perform logic and arithmetic operations in images.

## Requirements
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

Linux already comes with a python version, is a bit old, so i recommend you to update it.
I have python3.7 here, so im using it.

First, lets install pip, a python package manager:
```bash
$ python3.7 -m pip install pip
```

Now, install OpenCV:
```bash
$ pip3.7 install opencv-contrib-python
```

Testing if the OpenCV is correctly installed:
```bash
$ python3.7     # will open the Python terminal
```
Import the OpenCV package and log the version of it:
```python
import cv2
cv2._version_
```
If no errors, we are done.

## Running the program
To run the program, just do:
```bash
$ python3.7 logic-arithmetic.py
```
